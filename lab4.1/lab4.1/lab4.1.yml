# come up with an original name for your new langauge
language_name: Simple

# explain a little what inspired your language and why it's cool
language_explanation: |
    In lab 2, before we had seen Scheme, I had the idea of making a function-based language. Although I didn't understand what that fully entailed, I thought I could simplify writing a language by making everything "like a function".

# this is the example program that you make up

    &Example program for simple language&

    print (string [Wow this is going to be so great])

    define function lovemore(string s1 bool b)

            if (b (assign (string s1 concat ([I love ] s1))) (assign (string s1 concat ([I hate ] s1))))

            (
                    assign (string i [])
